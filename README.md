# BG Image Formatter

This module provides an image formatter that allows you to set an image in
background of a tag. The images are from a field of an entity and not from a
configuration page or a custom entity or something else, so it's very easy to
setup and manage.

*Use cases:*

- You want to display a image on the back of a div when viewing a particular node.
- You want to display a random image on the back of a div on the frontpage only.
  This can be done using Views. Create a block, select the "Background Image"
  formatter for your image field, save, place the block, done.
